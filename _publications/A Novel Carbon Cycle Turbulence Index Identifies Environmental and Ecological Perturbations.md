# excerpt: 'Earth's history has been characterised by complex interactions between life and the environment, which are often difficult to resolve. Here, we propose a new carbon cycle turbulence index (CTindex), based on the carbonate-carbon isotope ({$\delta$}13Ccarb) record, to measure the extent of environmental perturbation over the last billion years. The CTindex trend is closely linked to Phanerozoic biotic extinction rates (ERs), as calculated from a palaeobiology database, supporting a strong environmental control on biotic ERs. We use the empirical CTindex\textemdash ER relationship to compare the extent of environmental perturbation due to greenhouse gas emissions with that during the Permian-Triassic (PTr) transition ({$\sim$}252 Ma), representing the most severe mass extinction of the Phanerozoic. At the current peak of fossil fuel emissions, the CTindex indicates a moderate future environmental perturbation. However, if fossil fuel emissions increase into the next century, a pronounced CTindex peak greater than that which occurred during the PTr transition is indicated, which suggests the potential for a severe ``sixth mass extinction'' in the future.'
