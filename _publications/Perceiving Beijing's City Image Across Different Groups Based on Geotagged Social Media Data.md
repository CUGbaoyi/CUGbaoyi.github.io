# excerpt: 'City image in general refers to the perception, the feeling, and the opinion of a city, which contributes great importance to urban management, urban planning, urban cultural perceptions, and tourism resource development. Traditionally, city image is often inferred by the `five-element' model of physical factors while lacking the consideration of subjective perception. With the rising penetration of smart mobile devices and social media, massive data of location-related texts has been generated for a variety of urban areas. The accessibility to the big data leads to a new approach of understanding the subjective perception of city image, which is important since the new approach takes the subjective heterogeneity into account. Based on the Beijing's Weibo (microblog) data in the year of 2016, we use a random forest model to categorize user backgrounds into locals and non-locals. Meanwhile, spatial clustering is applied to identify hotspots. Then two text analysis methods-term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-are adopted to abstract topics regarding the different geographical hotspots in the city across the different groups of individuals. Our research shows text mining on geotagged big data for city image makes it possible to accommodate the heterogeneity of the activities of different groups of people and to understand their preferences for different points of interests in the city, and thereby reveals the socio-cultural and functional features for the city.'
